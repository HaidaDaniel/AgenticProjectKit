# Decisions

This file records architecture and product decisions that affect the implementation.

## ADR-0001 - Repository-first source of truth

Status: accepted

Decision:

Project context, rules, and task definitions live in the repository rather than in chat history.

Reason:

Repository-stored context can be reviewed, versioned, and exported to multiple tools.

## ADR-0002 - Neutral policy with exporters

Status: accepted

Decision:

The core behavior is defined once and exported to tool-specific instruction files.

Reason:

This reduces duplication and prevents tool-specific instruction drift.

Implementation:

Task 0006 adds a neutral agent policy input and renders AGENTS, Codex, OpenCode, and Cursor instruction files from shared exporter templates.

## ADR-0003 - Task-driven execution

Status: accepted

Decision:

Work should be organized as small, atomic tasks with explicit context, allowed files, and verification commands.

Reason:

Smaller tasks are easier for agents to complete safely and easier for humans to review.

## ADR-0004 - CLI first, no UI in v0.1

Status: accepted

Decision:

The first implementation is a TypeScript CLI, not a web application.

Reason:

The highest-value early behavior is repository automation, not a UI layer.

## ADR-0005 - Handlebars templates

Status: accepted

Decision:

Use Handlebars for template rendering in the implementation.

Reason:

The templating problem is simple and predictable, and Handlebars is a lightweight fit for text generation.

Implementation:

Task 0004 adds Handlebars as the renderer dependency for reusable text templates.

## ADR-0006 - Caveman as default style

Status: accepted

Decision:

Use the `caveman` skill as the default output style for this repository when the active agent supports it.

Reason:

This keeps instructions compact, reduces filler, and matches the repo goal of explicit, task-driven agent work.

## ADR-0007 - Minimal CLI scaffold dependencies

Status: accepted

Decision:

Use `typescript`, `tsx`, and `@types/node` for the initial CLI scaffold.

Reason:

This combination gives a small TypeScript development loop with direct execution in local development and proper Node globals in type checking.

## ADR-0008 - Conservative adopt writes

Status: accepted

Decision:

`apk adopt` scans existing repositories and writes only missing kit, documentation, task, and exporter files.

Reason:

Adoption must preserve application code and avoid overwriting existing project instructions or docs.
